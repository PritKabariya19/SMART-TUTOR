In other words, they have both\\nmass* and volume**.\\nSince early times, human beings have\\nbeen trying to understand their surroundings.\\nEarly Indian philosophers classified matter in\\nthe form of five basic elements — the “Panch\\nTatva” — air , earth, fir e, sky and water .\\nAccording to them everything, living or non-\\nliving, was made up of these five basic\\nelements.

We can see that\\nmatter ar ound us exists in thr ee dif ferent\\nstates– solid, liquid and gas. These states of\\nmatter arise due to the variation in the\\ncharacteristics of the particles of matter.\\nNow, let us study about the properties of\\nthese three states of matter in detail.\\n1.3.1 THE SOLID STATE\\nActivity _____________  1.9\\n• Collect the following articles — a pen,\\na book, a needle and a piece of wooden\\nstick.\\n• Sketch the shape of the above articles\\nin your notebook by moving a pencil\\naround them.\\n• Do all these have a definite shape,\\ndistinct boundaries and a fixed volume?\\n• What happens if they are hammered,\\npulled or dropped?\\n• Are these capable of diffusing into each\\nother?\\n• Try compr essing them by applying\\nforce. Are you able to compress them?\\nAll the above ar e examples of solids. W e\\ncan observe that all these have a definite\\nshape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes,\\nthat is, have negligible compressibility. Solids\\nhave a tendency to maintain their shape when\\nsubjected to outside force. Solids may break\\nunder force but it is difficult to change their\\nshape, so they are rigid.\\nConsider the following:\\n(a) What about a rubber band, can it\\nchange its shape on stretching? Is it\\na solid?\\n(b) What about sugar and salt? When\\nkept in different jars these take the\\nshape of the jar. Are they solid?\\n(c) What about a sponge? It is a solid\\nyet we are able to compr\\ness it. Why?\\nAll the above are solids as:\\n• A rubber band changes shape under\\nforce and regains the same shape when\\nthe force is removed. If excessive force is\\napplied, it breaks.\\n• The shape of each individual sugar or\\nsalt crystal r emains fixed, whether we\\ntake it in our hand, put it in a plate or in\\na jar.\\n• A sponge has minute holes, in which\\nair is trapped, when we press it, the air\\nis expelled out and we ar e able to\\ncompress it.\\n1.3.2 THE LIQUID STATE\\nActivity _____________1.10\\n• Collect the following:\\n(a) water, cooking oil, milk, juice, a\\ncold drink.\\n(b) containers of different shapes. Put\\na 50 mL mark on these containers\\nusing a measuring cylinder fr om\\nthe laboratory.\\n• What will happen if these liquids ar e\\nspilt on the floor?\\n• Measure 50 mL of any one liquid and\\ntransfer it into different containers one\\nby one. Does the volume r emain the\\nsame?\\n• Does the shape of the liquid remain the\\nsame ?\\n• When you pour the liquid fr om one\\ncontainer into another , does it flow\\neasily?\\nWe observe that liquids have no fixed\\nshape but have a fixed volume. They take up\\nthe shape of the container in which they are\\nkept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they\\nare not rigid but can be called fluid.\\nRefer  to activities 1.4 and 1.5 wher e we\\nsaw that solids and liquids can dif fuse into\\nliquids. The gases fr om the atmosphere\\ndiffuse and dissolve in water . These gases,\\nespecially oxygen and carbon dioxide, ar e\\nessential for the survival of aquatic animals\\nand plants.\\nAll living cr eatures need to br eathe for\\nsurvival.

The liquefied petr oleum gas (LPG)\\ncylinder that we get in our home for cooking\\nor the oxygen supplied to hospitals in\\ncylinders is compr essed gas. Compr essed\\nnatural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days\\nin vehicles.

Due to\\nhigh speed of particles and lar ge space\\nbetween   them, gases show the pr operty of\\ndiffusing very fast into other gases.\\nIn the gaseous state, the particles move\\nabout randomly at high speed.

The\\nparticles leave their fixed positions and start\\nmoving more freely. A stage is reached when\\nthe solid melts and is converted to a liquid.\\nThe minimum temperature at which a solid\\nmelts to become a liquid at the atmospheric\\npressure is called its melting point.\\nThe melting point of a solid is an indication\\nof the strength of the force of attraction\\nbetween its particles.\\nThe melting point of ice is 273.15 K*. The\\nprocess of melting, that is, change of solid\\nstate into liquid state is also known as fusion.\\nWhen a solid melts, its temperature\\nremains the same, so where does the heat\\nenergy go?\\nYou must have observed, during the\\nexperiment of melting, that the temperature\\nof the system does not change after the\\nmelting point is reached, till all the ice melts.\\nThis happens even though we continue to\\nheat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply\\nheat. This heat gets used up in changing the\\nstate by overcoming the forces of attraction\\nbetween the particles. As this heat energy is\\nabsorbed by ice without showing any rise in\\ntemperatur e, it is consider ed that it gets\\nhidden into the contents of the beaker and is\\nknown as the latent heat. The wor d latent\\nmeans hidden. The amount of heat ener gy\\nthat is required to change 1 kg of a solid into\\nliquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting\\npoint is known as the latent heat of fusion.\\nSo, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more\\nenergy as compared to particles in ice at the\\nsame temperature.\\nWhen we supply heat ener gy to water ,\\nparticles start moving even faster.  At a certain\\ntemperature, a point is r eached when the\\nparticles have enough energy to break fr ee\\nfrom the forces of attraction of each other. At\\nthis temperature the liquid starts changing\\ninto gas. The temperature at which a liquid\\nstarts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is\\nknown as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk\\nphenomenon.

We can see that\\nmatter ar ound us exists in thr ee dif ferent\\nstates– solid, liquid and gas. These states of\\nmatter arise due to the variation in the\\ncharacteristics of the particles of matter.\\nNow, let us study about the properties of\\nthese three states of matter in detail.\\n1.3.1 THE SOLID STATE\\nActivity _____________  1.9\\n• Collect the following articles — a pen,\\na book, a needle and a piece of wooden\\nstick.\\n• Sketch the shape of the above articles\\nin your notebook by moving a pencil\\naround them.\\n• Do all these have a definite shape,\\ndistinct boundaries and a fixed volume?\\n• What happens if they are hammered,\\npulled or dropped?\\n• Are these capable of diffusing into each\\nother?\\n• Try compr essing them by applying\\nforce. Are you able to compress them?\\nAll the above ar e examples of solids. W e\\ncan observe that all these have a definite\\nshape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes,\\nthat is, have negligible compressibility. Solids\\nhave a tendency to maintain their shape when\\nsubjected to outside force. Solids may break\\nunder force but it is difficult to change their\\nshape, so they are rigid.\\nConsider the following:\\n(a) What about a rubber band, can it\\nchange its shape on stretching? Is it\\na solid?\\n(b) What about sugar and salt? When\\nkept in different jars these take the\\nshape of the jar. Are they solid?\\n(c) What about a sponge? It is a solid\\nyet we are able to compr\\ness it. Why?\\nAll the above are solids as:\\n• A rubber band changes shape under\\nforce and regains the same shape when\\nthe force is removed. If excessive force is\\napplied, it breaks.\\n• The shape of each individual sugar or\\nsalt crystal r emains fixed, whether we\\ntake it in our hand, put it in a plate or in\\na jar.\\n• A sponge has minute holes, in which\\nair is trapped, when we press it, the air\\nis expelled out and we ar e able to\\ncompress it.\\n1.3.2 THE LIQUID STATE\\nActivity _____________1.10\\n• Collect the following:\\n(a) water, cooking oil, milk, juice, a\\ncold drink.\\n(b) containers of different shapes. Put\\na 50 mL mark on these containers\\nusing a measuring cylinder fr om\\nthe laboratory.\\n• What will happen if these liquids ar e\\nspilt on the floor?\\n• Measure 50 mL of any one liquid and\\ntransfer it into different containers one\\nby one. Does the volume r emain the\\nsame?\\n• Does the shape of the liquid remain the\\nsame ?\\n• When you pour the liquid fr om one\\ncontainer into another , does it flow\\neasily?\\nWe observe that liquids have no fixed\\nshape but have a fixed volume. They take up\\nthe shape of the container in which they are\\nkept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they\\nare not rigid but can be called fluid.\\nRefer  to activities 1.4 and 1.5 wher e we\\nsaw that solids and liquids can dif fuse into\\nliquids. The gases fr om the atmosphere\\ndiffuse and dissolve in water . These gases,\\nespecially oxygen and carbon dioxide, ar e\\nessential for the survival of aquatic animals\\nand plants.\\nAll living cr eatures need to br eathe for\\nsurvival. The aquatic animals can br eathe\\nunder water due to the presence of dissolved\\noxygen  in water. Thus, we may conclude that\\nsolids, liquids and gases can diffuse into\\nliquids.

This is due to the\\nfact that in the liquid state, particles move\\nfreely and have greater space between each\\nother as compared to particles in the solid\\nstate.\\n1.3.3 THE GASEOUS STATE\\nHave you ever observed a balloon seller filling\\na lar ge number of balloons fr om a single\\ncylinder of gas? Enquire from him how many\\nballoons is he able to fill fr om one cylinder.\\nAsk him which gas does he have in the cylinder.\\nActivity _____________1.11\\n• Take three 100 mL syringes and close\\ntheir nozzles by  rubber corks, as\\nshown in Fig.1.4.\\n• Remove the pistons fr om all the\\nsyringes.\\n• Leaving one syringe untouched, fill\\nwater in the second and pieces of chalk\\nin the third.\\n• Insert the pistons back into the\\nsyringes. You may apply some vaseline\\non the pistons befor e inserting them\\ninto the syringes for their smooth\\nmovement.\\n• Now, try to compr ess the content by\\npushing the piston in each syringe.\\nWe have observed that gases ar e highly\\ncompr essible as compared to solids and\\nliquids. The liquefied petr oleum gas (LPG)\\ncylinder that we get in our home for cooking\\nor the oxygen supplied to hospitals in\\ncylinders is compr essed gas. Compr essed\\nnatural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days\\nin vehicles. Due to its high compr essibility,\\nlarge volumes of a gas can be compr essed\\ninto a small cylinder and transported easily.\\nWe  come to know of what is being cooked\\nin the kitchen without even entering ther e,\\nby the smell that r\\neaches our nostrils. How\\ndoes this smell reach us? The particles of the\\naroma of food mix with the particles of air\\nspread from the kitchen, reach us and even\\nfarther away. The smell of hot cooked food\\nreaches us in seconds; compare this with the\\nrate of diffusion of solids and liquids. Due to\\nhigh speed of particles and lar ge space\\nbetween   them, gases show the pr operty of\\ndiffusing very fast into other gases.\\nIn the gaseous state, the particles move\\nabout randomly at high speed. Due to this\\nrandom movement, the particles hit each\\nother and also the walls of the container. The\\npressure exerted by the gas is because of this\\nforce exerted by gas particles per unit ar ea\\non the walls of the container.\\nFig. 1.4\\n• What do you observe?

The\\nparticles leave their fixed positions and start\\nmoving more freely. A stage is reached when\\nthe solid melts and is converted to a liquid.\\nThe minimum temperature at which a solid\\nmelts to become a liquid at the atmospheric\\npressure is called its melting point.\\nThe melting point of a solid is an indication\\nof the strength of the force of attraction\\nbetween its particles.\\nThe melting point of ice is 273.15 K*. The\\nprocess of melting, that is, change of solid\\nstate into liquid state is also known as fusion.\\nWhen a solid melts, its temperature\\nremains the same, so where does the heat\\nenergy go?\\nYou must have observed, during the\\nexperiment of melting, that the temperature\\nof the system does not change after the\\nmelting point is reached, till all the ice melts.\\nThis happens even though we continue to\\nheat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply\\nheat. This heat gets used up in changing the\\nstate by overcoming the forces of attraction\\nbetween the particles. As this heat energy is\\nabsorbed by ice without showing any rise in\\ntemperatur e, it is consider ed that it gets\\nhidden into the contents of the beaker and is\\nknown as the latent heat. The wor d latent\\nmeans hidden. The amount of heat ener gy\\nthat is required to change 1 kg of a solid into\\nliquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting\\npoint is known as the latent heat of fusion.\\nSo, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more\\nenergy as compared to particles in ice at the\\nsame temperature.\\nWhen we supply heat ener gy to water ,\\nparticles start moving even faster.  At a certain\\ntemperature, a point is r eached when the\\nparticles have enough energy to break fr ee\\nfrom the forces of attraction of each other. At\\nthis temperature the liquid starts changing\\ninto gas. The temperature at which a liquid\\nstarts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is\\nknown as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk\\nphenomenon. Particles from the bulk of the\\nliquid gain enough energy to change into the\\nvapour state.\\nFor water this temperature is 373 K\\n(100oC = 273 + 100 = 373 K).\\nCan you define the latent heat of\\nvaporisation? Do it in the same way as we\\nhave defined the latent heat of fusion.\\nParticles in steam, that is, water vapour at\\n373 K (1000 C) have more energy than water\\nat the same temperatur e. This is because\\nparticles in steam have absorbed extra energy\\nin the form of latent heat of vaporisation.\\n*Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0o C = 273 K after\\nrounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you\\nhave to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius\\nscale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.\\nSo, we infer that the state of matter can\\nbe changed into another state by changing\\nthe temperature.\\nWe have lear nt that substances ar ound\\nus change state from solid to liquid and from\\nliquid to gas on application of heat.
